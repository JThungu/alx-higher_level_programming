# ALX x0F - Python Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)
Done by Joseph Thungu

## Overview
This project demonstrates the concept of Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) in Python. An ORM is a programming technique that allows you to interact with a relational database using Python classes and objects, making it easier to manage database operations and relationships.

In this project, we've implemented a simple ORM system that provides a basic framework for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a MySQL database. This README provides an overview of the project structure, how to set it up, and how to use it.

## Installation
To get started with this ORM project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:


## Usage
Now that you've set up the project, you can start using the ORM to interact with your database. Here's a brief guide on how to use it:

1. Define your data models: Create Python classes that inherit from `BaseModel` and define the fields you want to store in your database.

2. Create instances of your models and save them to the database:

```python
from models import User

user = User(username='johndoe', email='johndoe@example.com')
user.save()
