#Python Test-Driven Project
Welcome to the Python Test-Driven Project! This project is designed to showcase the principles and practices of test-driven development (TDD) in Python. By following the instructions in this README, you will learn how to build a Python project using TDD methodologies.

Each test module should correspond to a module in the app/ directory.
Name your test modules with a prefix of test_, e.g., test_your_module.py.
Use the unittest module or any other testing framework of your choice.
Write test cases that cover different scenarios and edge cases.
Run the tests frequently to ensure your code remains correct as you make changes.
