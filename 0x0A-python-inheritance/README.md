#Python - Inheritance
#Overview
This is a simple guide explaining the concept of inheritance in Python. Inheritance is a fundamental feature of object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows classes to inherit attributes and methods from other classes, known as parent or base classes. It promotes code reuse, modularity, and enables the creation of hierarchies of related classes.
